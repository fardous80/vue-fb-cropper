    <h1>Facebook like Image / Avatar Cropper</h1>

  Resize and crop image on client side bedore uploading them to your web app. This Vuejs Image cropper components has taken its inspiration from facebook profile image uploader and it closely mimics all of it's features. You can zoom image, drag it to your preferred position and then crop it. It will then generate a base64 image datauri which you can post to your application. You can zoom image using range slide or mouse wheel. It also works on touchscreen. The component is also responsive and works well on all modern iOS and android smartphones and tablets.

  The component has some rough edges which needs fixing and lacking any documentation at this point. But if you are a VueJs or JavaScript experts you can easily custozite and fit it into your project. I will be soon adding a demo for this product and simple quick guide on how to install and configure it.
